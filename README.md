This project has the goal to predict Jewel price from it's description.

My mother is expert in jewelery since a long time. as I were a kid i sometimes helped 
her at her work, that work was often to describe jewelery on a microsoft exel document.

As I grow up and learned computer science, I had a crasy idea. Why not use ages of expertises
from my mother as a dataset, and use a Regression Algorithm to teach an IA to predict Price of
jewelery, and then compare with the accuracy of my mother expertise.
